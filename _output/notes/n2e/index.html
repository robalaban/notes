            <p>I've been putting off building a personal website for such a long time. I couldn't find a good enough reason to spend time creating one. Questions like the following kept coming up:</p>
<ul>
<li>Are personal website <em>even</em> useful in the era of Twitter / Github?</li>
<li>Is my content worth sharing?</li>
<li>What if people don't like the my content?</li>
</ul>
<p>However, I still found myself day-dreaming of what my &quot;corner&quot; of the web would look like. I had to change perspective, I had to make the project interesting enough. Turns out, making a personal website is the perfect opportunity to pick-up and learn some new technologies / methodologies. After spending a good few hours --searching-- googleing - I stumbled upon a few really interesting projects that I had to give a try. The culprits composing the stack for my webiste are the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.snowpack.dev/">Snowpack</a> - Build tool</li>
<li><a href="https://postcss.org/">PostCSS</a> - Modern CSS</li>
<li><a href="https://native-elements.dev/">Native Elements</a> - HTML Components</li>
<li><a href="https://www.11ty.dev/">Eleventy</a> - Static Site Generator</li>
</ul>
<p>With this being said - I would like to introduce <a href="github.com">n2e</a> short for Note! A <em>very</em> opiniated way of publishing blog posts backed by E11Y.</p>
