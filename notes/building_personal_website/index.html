            <p>I've been putting off building a personal website for such a long time. I couldn't find a good enough reason to spend time creating one. Questions like the following kept coming up:</p>
<ul>
<li>Are personal website <em>even</em> useful in the era of Twitter / Github?</li>
<li>Is my content worth sharing?</li>
</ul>
<p>However, I still found myself thinking of what my <em>&quot;corner&quot;</em> of the web would look like. I had to change perspective, I had to make the project interesting enough. Luckily turns out that making a personal website is the perfect opportunity to pick-up and learn some new technologies / methodologies. After spending a good few hours seaching - I stumbled upon a few really interesting projects that I had to give a try. The culprits composing the stack for my webiste are the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.snowpack.dev/">Snowpack</a> - Build tool</li>
<li><a href="https://postcss.org/">PostCSS</a> - Modern CSS</li>
<li><a href="https://native-elements.dev/">Native Elements</a> - HTML Components</li>
<li><a href="https://www.11ty.dev/">Eleventy</a> - Static Site Generator</li>
</ul>
<p>Now that I have chosen and am pretty happy with the stack, I had to find out why build something from the ground up, and not use an existing framework / starter template? The answer was quite simple: <em>I want to make the website as user friendly as possible.</em> Things that are important to me:</p>
<ul>
<li>Accessability ( fonts, colors, navigation )</li>
<li>Quick build time ( The turnaround time needs to be fast )</li>
<li>Serverless ( I don't want to have any dependencies )</li>
</ul>
<h3>Setting up the environment</h3>
<pre><code>mkdir Notes &amp;&amp; cd Notes
npm init -y
</code></pre>
