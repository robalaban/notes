            <p>Lets face it working fully remote is a complex subject, fortunatly the software industry is more or less accoustomed to this movement, as we can see from <a href="">some</a> <a href="">of</a> <a href="">the</a> <a href="">fully</a> remote dev houses. Nevertheless, we find ourselves in a world where remote work is encouraged and the norm. ( Who could have seen this coming? I certently did not. )</p>
<p>Turns out I had it totally wrong - it took me a good while to understand how to balance work and personal life while working from home. I want to share that experience.</p>
<h3>Build a schedule</h3>
<p>The one thing that helped me the most working from home was bringing some sort of &quot;normality&quot; to my days, this started by building a <em>at first</em> loose schedule of my day. Wake up times, lunch times, coffee breaks all the good stuff.</p>
<p>Tip - don't skip breakfast. Seriously don't.</p>
<p>Having a semi predictable schedule allows you to see how your time is being used, as well as opportunities to better manage it.</p>
<h3>Block out time in your calendar</h3>
<p>Your time is yours ü§Ø - why should the calendar be only for meetings? It takes some time and courage as well as having the appropriate culture in your workspace. However, productivity skyrocketed when I blocked out slots for &quot;deep work&quot;. This allowed me to schedule my days in such a way that meeting didn't interfere with my focus time. Context switching especially in meetings was the single most negative impact to my productivity.</p>
<p>I found out that early morning are the most effective for my &quot;head down&quot; deep work.</p>
<h3>Async communication</h3>
<p>The era of constant communication. Slack üëÄ I'm talking about you. Slack ( or any other form of instant messaging ) has given people the <em>wrong</em> idea that communication should happen instantly and that if you're not responding as soon as you get the messages you're seen as being rude and ignoring the person... Ok - maybe I'm over generalising this, fully aware it doesn't happen everywhere, but it does happen and we need to be aware on the impact it is causing.</p>
<p>I usually snooze Slack and change the status to <strong>Focusing - replies may be delayed</strong> - it has worked pretty well considering.</p>
<h3>Excercise</h3>
<p>Don't forget to exercise. I can't stress this enough - especially if like me you're spending a good chunk of your day sat on a chair typing away at a screen. There has been countless research on the positive effects on productivity ( concentration ) - of having an active lifestyle.</p>
<h4>Lets see some Data</h4>
<p>This wouldn't be such a beneficial post if we don't look at some data and see how patterns change over time in the era of remote working. For this study I will be focusing on just myself pulling data from various sources. Initially we'll be looking at Github for individual project contribuctions as well as Outlook for meetings information.</p>
