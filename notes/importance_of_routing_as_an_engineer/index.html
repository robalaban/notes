            <p>I have never worked from home or &quot;remote&quot; until the COVID-19 pandemic started, and I'm not going to downplay it, the first month or so - it was chaos. Long hours, endless meetings, I was getting frustrated at work. I continued like so for the next weeks and months - downplaying the impact remote working is having on my mental health and lifestyle, after all I really enjoy my work, small price to pay no?</p>
<p>Turns out I had it totally wrong - it took me a good while to understand how to balance work and personal life while working from home. I want to share that experience.</p>
<ul>
<li>Build a schedule</li>
</ul>
<p>The one thing that helped me the most working from home was bringing some sort of &quot;normality&quot; to my days, this started by building a <em>at first</em> loose schedule of my day. Wake up times, lunch times, coffee breaks all the good stuff.</p>
<p>Tip - don't skip breakfast. Seriously don't.</p>
<ul>
<li>Block out time in your calendar</li>
</ul>
<p>Your time is yours ü§Ø - why should the calendar be only for meetings? It takes some time and courage as well as having the appropriate culture in your workspace. However, productivity skyrocketed when I blocked out slots for &quot;deep work&quot;. This allowed me to schedule my days in such a way that meeting didn't interfere with my focus time. Context switching especially in meetings was the single most negative impact to my productivity.</p>
<ul>
<li>Async communication</li>
</ul>
<p>The era of constant communication. Slack üëÄ I'm talking about you. Slack ( or any other form of instant messaging ) has given people the <em>wrong</em> idea that communication should happen instantly and that if you're not responding as soon as you get the messages you're a) being rude or b) &quot;not working&quot;. This has to be the single most disruptive tool in the arsenal of remote working.</p>
<ul>
<li>Physical health</li>
</ul>
<p>Don't forget to exercise. I can't stress this enough - especially if like me you're spending a good chunk of your day sat on a chair typing away at a screen. There has been countless research on the positive effects on productivity ( concentration ) - of having an active lifestyle.</p>
<p>Having exposed a few tips and ideas and their impact / consequence in the workplace: How do we build a schedule?</p>
