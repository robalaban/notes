I've been putting off building a personal website for such a long time. I couldn't find a good enough reason to spend time creating one. Questions like the following kept coming up:

-   Are personal website _even_ useful in the era of Twitter / Github?
-   Is my content worth sharing?
-   What if people don't like the my content?

However, I still found myself day-dreaming of what my "corner" of the web would look like. I had to change perspective, I had to make the project interesting enough. Turns out, making a personal website is the perfect opportunity to pick-up and learn some new technologies / methodologies. After spending a good few hours --searching-- googleing - I stumbled upon a few really interesting projects that I had to give a try. The culprits composing the stack for my webiste are the following:

-   [Snowpack](https://www.snowpack.dev/) - Build tool
-   [PostCSS](https://postcss.org/) - Modern CSS
-   [Native Elements](https://native-elements.dev/) - HTML Components
-   [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/) - Static Site Generator
