Lets face it working fully remote is a complex subject, fortunatly the software industry is more or less accoustomed to this movement, as we can see from [some]() [of]() [the]() [fully]() remote dev houses. Nevertheless, we find ourselves in a world where remote work is encouraged and the norm. ( Who could have seen this coming? I certently did not. )

Turns out I had it totally wrong - it took me a good while to understand how to balance work and personal life while working from home. I want to share that experience.

### Build a schedule

The one thing that helped me the most working from home was bringing some sort of "normality" to my days, this started by building a _at first_ loose schedule of my day. Wake up times, lunch times, coffee breaks all the good stuff.

Tip - don't skip breakfast. Seriously don't.

Having a semi predictable schedule allows you to see how your time is being used, as well as opportunities to better manage it.

### Block out time in your calendar

Your time is yours ðŸ¤¯ - why should the calendar be only for meetings? It takes some time and courage as well as having the appropriate culture in your workspace. However, productivity skyrocketed when I blocked out slots for "deep work". This allowed me to schedule my days in such a way that meeting didn't interfere with my focus time. Context switching especially in meetings was the single most negative impact to my productivity.

I found out that early morning are the most effective for my "head down" deep work.

### Async communication

The era of constant communication. Slack ðŸ‘€ I'm talking about you. Slack ( or any other form of instant messaging ) has given people the _wrong_ idea that communication should happen instantly and that if you're not responding as soon as you get the messages you're seen as being rude and ignoring the person... Ok - maybe I'm over generalising this, fully aware it doesn't happen everywhere, but it does happen and we need to be aware on the impact it is causing.

I usually snooze Slack and change the status to **Focusing - replies may be delayed** - it has worked pretty well considering.

### Excercise

Don't forget to exercise. I can't stress this enough - especially if like me you're spending a good chunk of your day sat on a chair typing away at a screen. There has been countless research on the positive effects on productivity ( concentration ) - of having an active lifestyle.

#### Lets see some Data

This wouldn't be such a beneficial post if we don't look at some data and see how patterns change over time in the era of remote working. For this study I will be focusing on just myself pulling data from various sources. Initially we'll be looking at Github for individual project contribuctions as well as Outlook for meetings information.
