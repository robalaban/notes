I have never worked from home or "remote" until the COVID-19 pandemic started, and I'm not going to downplay it, the first month or so - it was chaos. Long hours, endless meetings, I was getting frustrated at work. I continued like so for the next weeks and months - downplaying the impact remote working is having on my mental health and lifestyle, after all I really enjoy my work, small price to pay no?

Turns out I had it totally wrong - it took me a good while to understand how to balance work and personal life while working from home. I want to share that experience.

-   Build a schedule

The one thing that helped me the most working from home was bringing some sort of "normality" to my days, this started by building a _at first_ loose schedule of my day. Wake up times, lunch times, coffee breaks all the good stuff.

Tip - don't skip breakfast. Seriously don't.

Having a semi predictable schedule allows you to see how your time is being used, as well as opportunities to better manage it.

-   Block out time in your calendar

Your time is yours ðŸ¤¯ - why should the calendar be only for meetings? It takes some time and courage as well as having the appropriate culture in your workspace. However, productivity skyrocketed when I blocked out slots for "deep work". This allowed me to schedule my days in such a way that meeting didn't interfere with my focus time. Context switching especially in meetings was the single most negative impact to my productivity.

I found out that early morning are the most effective for my "head down" deep work.

-   Async communication

The era of constant communication. Slack ðŸ‘€ I'm talking about you. Slack ( or any other form of instant messaging ) has given people the _wrong_ idea that communication should happen instantly and that if you're not responding as soon as you get the messages you're:

    a) being rude
    b) "not working"

This has to be the single most disruptive tool in the arsenal of remote working, no one is saying ignore messages but do not let them distract you from what you're doing.

-   Physical health

Don't forget to exercise. I can't stress this enough - especially if like me you're spending a good chunk of your day sat on a chair typing away at a screen. There has been countless research on the positive effects on productivity ( concentration ) - of having an active lifestyle.

#### Lets see some Data

This wouldn't be such a beneficial post if we don't look at some data and see how patterns change over time in the era of remote working. For this study I will be focusing on just myself pulling data from various sources. Initially we'll be looking at Github for individual project contribuctions as well as Outlook for meetings information.
