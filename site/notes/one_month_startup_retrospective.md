Has it already been a month. That's my general state of though, time seams to be speeding up when stuck being at home and your only window to society has become through the internet.

At the begging of the month I've proposed to myself to make January the month that kickstarts my startup journey, but this hasn't been without kicks, so I figured to keep me accountable I'm giong to write about the journey and share it with the internet. See, saying and drawing a plan is quite different than executing one.

On startup vs contracting.

I quit my day job back in December 2020, I took some time off and quickly realised I had to support myself if I was going to make my dream come true. There are generally two ways of approaching this:

-   Contracting

It makes sense,

The danger of contracting, welcoming the loop. On a day to day basis there isn't much difference between a standard full-time employee and a contractor. You still have to show up, put in the work, and sometimes ( take the work back home with you ), stress is mostly the same if not higher. Companies expect a bit more from contractors than regular employees, atleast that has been my experience so far.

So - there comes a point where we have to make a choice

to get contracts to support myself ( this whole startup thing would have been )
